This is how I installed LAPACK on Ubuntu while working for Prof Kung.

Starting files:
clapack.tgz (currently version 3.2.1 from http://www.netlib.org/clapack/)
dgesv_example.c (from http://theochem.mercer.edu/clapack/)
Makefile (from http://theochem.mercer.edu/clapack/)

Do the following exactly. (Official guide here: 
http://www.netlib.org/clapack/readme.install)

1. Place clapack.tgz in appropriate root folder.
2. 'tar xvf clapack.tgz' to create CLAPACK-3.2.1 folder
3. 'cd CLAPACK-3.2.1'
   'mv make.inc.example make.inc'
   'make f2clib' to build f2c libraries
   'make blaslib' to build the BLAS library included with distribution.
   'make' to build CLAPACK

That it for installation, but the trickier part is the Makefile due to
the varying versions of the source code online. If we use the dgesv_example.c
file from above, the Makefile should read:

-------------------------------------------------------------

CC = gcc
ROOTPATH = /home/wyao/CLAPACK-3.2.1
INCDIRS = -I$(ROOTPATH)/SRC -I$(ROOTPATH) \
          -I$(ROOTPATH)/INCLUDE
F2CDIR  = $(ROOTPATH)/F2CLIBS
LDLIBS  = $(ROOTPATH)/lapack_LINUX.a \
          $(ROOTPATH)/blas_LINUX.a \
	  $(F2CDIR)/libf2c.a -lm

dgesv_example: dgesv_example.o
	$(CC) dgesv_example.o  $(LDLIBS)  -o dgesv_example 

dgesv_example.o: dgesv_example.c
	$(CC) dgesv_example.c  $(INCDIRS) -c 

zgesv_example: zgesv_example.o
	$(CC) zgesv_example.o  $(LDLIBS)  -o zgesv_example 

zgesv_example.o: zgesv_example.c
	$(CC) zgesv_example.c  $(INCDIRS) -c 

-------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the library path to libf2c.a is different from the Makefile
from http://theochem.mercer.edu/clapack/Makefile. The ROOTPATH should
also be modified appropriately.

Place the Makefile and dgesv_example.c file in any directory. If you run 
make now, the executable dgesv_example file should be compiled successfully
(probably with a few inconsequential warnings).
