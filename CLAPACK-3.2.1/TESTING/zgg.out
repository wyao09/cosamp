 Matrix types (see ZDRVGG for details): 
 Special Matrices:                       (J'=transposed Jordan block)
   1=(0,0)  2=(I,0)  3=(0,I)  4=(I,I)  5=(J',J')  6=(diag(J',I), diag(I,J'))
 Diagonal Matrices:  ( D=diag(0,1,2,...) )
   7=(D,I)   9=(large*D, small*I)  11=(large*I, small*D)  13=(large*D, large*I)
   8=(I,D)  10=(small*D, large*I)  12=(small*I, large*D)  14=(small*D, small*I)
  15=(D, reversed D)
 Matrices Rotated by Random Unitary Matrices U, V:
  16=Transposed Jordan Blocks             19=geometric alpha, beta=0,1
  17=arithm. alpha&beta                   20=arithmetic alpha, beta=0,1
  18=clustered alpha, beta=0,1            21=random alpha, beta=0,1
 Large & Small Matrices:
  22=(large, small)   23=(small,large)    24=(small,small)    25=(large,large)
  26=random O(1) matrices.

 Tests performed:  (S is Schur, T is triangular, Q and Z are unitary,
                    l and r are the appropriate left and right
                   eigenvectors, resp., a is alpha, b is beta, and
                   * means conjugate transpose.)
 1 = | A - Q S Z* | / ( |A| n ulp )      2 = | B - Q T Z* | / ( |B| n ulp )
 3 = | I - QQ* | / ( n ulp )             4 = | I - ZZ* | / ( n ulp )
 5 = difference between (alpha,beta) and diagonals of (S,T)
 6 = max | ( b A - a B )* l | / const.   7 = max | ( b A - a B ) r | / const.

 Matrix order=    5, type=16, seed=2910, 603,2572,2141, result   6 is 4.504E+15
